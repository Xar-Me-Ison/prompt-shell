# PromptShell - Terminal Application
#### An absolute knock-off of Powershell, and an absolute hellhole of a program.

#### It includes some features "right of the box" that already exist but I decided to remake such as `mv`, `cp`, `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `echo` and `cat` among others.

#### All in all, it's a shitty subpar application that would be a pleasure to stay away from, but here it is regardless.

# Instructions
#### There is a simple `Makefile` there to do the job. Just type on `make`, and simply run `./prompt-shell`. There isn't much else to it.

# Licensing
#### Heheh yeah sure, uhm ask Saul Goodman about that. 

#### It's free to use, distribute and whatever else you want to do with it. 

#### Peace out.
